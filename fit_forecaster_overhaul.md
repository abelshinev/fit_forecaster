---

## Stage 1: Data Architecture & Pipeline Redesign

### 1.1 Current Data Analysis
**Your Dataset Structure:**
- `id`, `first_name`, `gender`, `Age`, `visit_per_week`
- `fav_group_lesson` (workout splits like "chest", "back", "Core", "Cardio", "Running", "Arm", "leg")
- `avg_time_check_in`, `avg_time_check_out`, `avg_time_in_gym`
- `Tue` (Boolean flag for Tuesday visits)

**Key Issues Identified:**
1. **Split Parsing Problem**: `fav_group_lesson` contains multiple splits in one field ("chest, back, Core")
2. **Limited Temporal Data**: Only average times, not actual visit timestamps
3. **Single Day Focus**: Only Tuesday data (Tue=TRUE)
4. **Static User Profiles**: No dynamic visit patterns

### 1.2 Database Schema Redesign
```sql
-- User Management
Users (
    user_id, first_name, gender, age, 
    visit_frequency_per_week, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Workout Split Definitions
WorkoutSplits (
    split_id, split_name, muscle_groups, 
    typical_duration, equipment_needed
)

-- User Preferences (Many-to-Many)
UserPreferences (
    user_id, split_id, preference_rank, 
    preferred_time_start, preferred_time_end
)

-- Actual Visit Records (Real-time data)
VisitRecords (
    visit_id, user_id, split_id, 
    check_in_time, check_out_time, visit_date,
    duration_minutes, day_of_week
)

-- Aggregated Traffic Data (for modeling)
TrafficData (
    date, day_of_week, split_id, time_slot,
    visitor_count, avg_duration, total_capacity_used
)

-- Recommendation Tracking
RecommendationLog (
    recommendation_id, split_id, recommended_time_slot,
    date_given, user_count_allocated, actual_attendance
)
```

### 1.3 Data Transformation Pipeline
**Phase 1: Historical Data Processing**
```python
def process_historical_data(df):
    # 1. Parse multiple splits from fav_group_lesson
    split_mapping = {
        'chest': 'Chest', 'back': 'Back', 'leg': 'Legs',
        'Core': 'Core', 'Cardio': 'Cardio', 'Running': 'Cardio',
        'Arm': 'Arms'
    }
    
    # 2. Convert average times to time slots
    # 3. Create synthetic visit records based on visit_per_week
    # 4. Generate realistic daily patterns from user averages
    # 5. Expand beyond just Tuesday data
```

**Phase 2: Feature Engineering**
- **Temporal Features**: Hour, day_of_week, month, is_weekend
- **User Features**: Age group, visit_frequency_category, preferred_split
- **Cyclical Encoding**: sin/cos for time of day, day of week
- **Capacity Features**: Gym capacity utilization, equipment availability
- **Lag Features**: Previous day/week attendance for same split
- **Rolling Statistics**: 3-day, 7-day moving averages of attendance

## Stage 2: Model Architecture Transformation

### 2.1 Model Selection for Multi-Split Forecasting
**Note**: RMSE is a metric, not a model. For your specific data structure, recommended architectures:

#### Primary Model: Ensemble Approach
1. **XGBoost Regressor**: Handles non-linear patterns, feature importance
2. **Prophet**: Captures seasonality and trends automatically
3. **Neural Network**: Deep learning component for complex patterns
4. **Ensemble Combiner**: Weighted average based on recent performance

#### Fallback Models
- **ARIMA/SARIMA**: For splits with limited data
- **Linear Regression**: Baseline comparison

### 2.2 Multi-Split Architecture
```python
# Model structure
SplitSpecificModels = {
    'chest': EnsembleModel(),
    'back': EnsembleModel(),
    'legs': EnsembleModel(),
    # ... for each split
}

GlobalModel = MetaLearner()  # Learns patterns across all splits
```

### 2.3 Adaptive Learning System
- **Online Learning**: Incremental model updates
- **Concept Drift Detection**: Monitor model performance degradation
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare model versions
- **Automated Retraining**: Scheduled model updates

## Stage 3: Smart Recommendation Engine

### 3.1 Traffic Distribution Algorithm
**Problem**: Prevent recommendation-induced congestion

#### Solution: Dynamic Allocation System
```python
class SmartRecommendationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recommendation_quotas = {}  # Track allocations per time slot
        self.congestion_threshold = 0.8  # 80% capacity
        
    def get_recommendation(self, split_type, preferred_times):
        # 1. Get predicted traffic for all time slots
        # 2. Identify low-traffic periods
        # 3. Check quota availability
        # 4. Allocate recommendation with quota tracking
        # 5. Update real-time model expectations
```

#### Key Features:
- **Quota Management**: Limit recommendations per time slot
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Secondary and tertiary options
- **Capacity Modeling**: Consider gym physical limits
- **Fairness Algorithm**: Rotate recommendations among users

### 3.2 Recommendation Strategies
1. **Immediate Recommendations**: For same-day workouts
2. **Weekly Planning**: Optimal times for the week ahead
3. **Personalized Scheduling**: Based on user history and preferences
4. **Group Coordination**: For users who prefer less crowded times

---

## Stage 4: Real-Time Learning & Adaptation

### 4.1 Continuous Learning Pipeline
```python
# Real-time update cycle
1. User Check-in → Data Validation → Feature Extraction
2. Compare Actual vs Predicted → Calculate Error
3. Update Model Weights (if error threshold exceeded)
4. Adjust Recommendation Quotas
5. Log Performance Metrics
```

### 4.2 Feedback Loop Management
- **Prediction Adjustment**: Account for own recommendations in future predictions
- **Recursive Learning**: Model learns from its own influence on traffic
- **Stability Mechanisms**: Prevent oscillatory behavior

### 4.3 Data Quality Assurance
- **Input Validation**: Realistic time ranges, valid split types
- **Outlier Detection**: Flag suspicious data entries
- **User Verification**: Optional check-out confirmation
- **Data Reconciliation**: Cross-validate with historical patterns

### 6.4 Addressing Your Data-Specific Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Multi-Split Parsing
```python
def parse_workout_splits(fav_group_lesson):
    """
    Parse compound workout preferences like 'chest, back, Core'
    """
    if pd.isna(fav_group_lesson):
        return ['General']
    
    splits = [s.strip() for s in str(fav_group_lesson).split(',')]
    return [standardize_split_name(split) for split in splits]

def create_user_split_matrix(df):
    """
    Create user-split preference matrix for recommendation system
    """
    # Transform current data structure to support multiple splits per user
```

#### Challenge 2: Limited Temporal Resolution
```python
def generate_realistic_visit_patterns(user_data):
    """
    From average check-in/out times and visit frequency,
    generate realistic daily visit patterns
    """
    # Use statistical distributions to create visit time variations
    # Account for personal schedules and preferences
    # Generate data for all days of week, not just Tuesday
```

#### Challenge 3: Cold Start Problem for New Splits
```python
class HybridRecommendationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.content_based = ContentBasedRecommender()  # For new splits
        self.collaborative = CollaborativeFilter()     # For popular splits
        self.time_series = TimeSeriesPredictor()      # For traffic patterns
    
    def recommend(self, split_type, user_preferences):
        if self.has_sufficient_data(split_type):
            return self.collaborative.predict(split_type)
        else:
            return self.content_based.predict(split_type, user_preferences)
```
